 * Cell formatters
 * Inspired by Teable's formatting system
 *
 * Formatters are used to convert raw cell data into display strings
 * and parse display strings back into raw data.
 *
 * This file will export all formatters as they are implemented:
 * - NumberFormatter (Phase 3)
 * - PhoneFormatter (Phase 4)
